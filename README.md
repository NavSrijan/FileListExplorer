# FileListExplorer
FileListExplorer is a high-performance, cross-platform file manager designed to display and preview only a user-supplied, curated list of files from a CSV file. Unlike traditional file managers, FileListExplorer focuses on selective file review, making it ideal for editors, reviewers, and anyone working with a specific set of files.
