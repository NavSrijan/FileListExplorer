# FileListExplorer

**FileListExplorer** is a high-performance, cross-platform file manager designed to display and preview only a user-supplied, curated list of files from a CSV file. Unlike traditional file managers, FileListExplorer focuses on selective file review, making it ideal for editors, reviewers, and anyone working with a specific set of files.

## Key Features

- **CSV-Driven:** Load a CSV file containing file paths and optional metadata (like file size).
- **Unified List:** View all files in a single, sortable list, regardless of their original folder locations.
- **Thumbnails & Previews:** Fast, cached thumbnails for images; instant video and image preview pane.
- **Resizable & Customizable UI:** Drag to resize panes, switch between list and tile views, and zoom thumbnails in tile mode.
- **Cross-Platform Path Support:** Works with both Windows and Linux-style file paths, even when running on Windows.
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Drag files directly into editing software like Premiere Pro.
- **Optimized Performance:** All heavy operations (like thumbnail generation) are offloaded to background threads for a lag-free experience.

FileListExplorer is perfect for workflows where you need to review, organize, or process a specific set of filesâ€”quickly and efficiently.
